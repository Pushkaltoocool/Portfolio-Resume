        <h3>
          During 2023, I had the privilege of serving as the VIA Chairperson. One of the most enriching experiences was working with students from St. Andrew’s Autism School over 5-6 months. I learned the value of patience and empathy while building connections with them. Highlights included hosting their visit to my school during National Day, where I served as their buddy. This experience taught me the importance of inclusion and the joy of fostering meaningful connections.
