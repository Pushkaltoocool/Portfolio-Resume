    <section id="via">
        <h1>VIA</h1>
        <p>As previously mentioned, I was the VIA Chairperson in 2023. As the VIA Chairperson, I had the enriching experience of visiting St. Andrew's Autism School over the course of 5-6 months to support and engage with the students there. This opportunity allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the unique challenges and strengths of individuals with autism. One of the highlights was during National Day when we invited some of the children to visit my school. I was appointed as their buddy, which was an incredibly rewarding experience. I learned the importance of patience, empathy, and the joy of building meaningful connections. This role not only enhanced my leadership skills but also taught me the value of inclusion and the impact of small acts of kindness in fostering a supportive community.</p>

    <section id="projects">
        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <p>My coding journey started in Primary 3 when I joined the Infocomm Club. I started off with coding in Scratch, but I have developed coding skills in much more complex languages since then. I have also taken the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy. I have participated in prestigous proramming tournaments as well. In particular, I participated in National Olympiad In Informatics in 2024 and had a PRELIM SCORE of 235. I had qualified for the finals, but had to give up my spot as I had a Chess Competition for my CCA the same day.</p>

I've achieved Black Belt Dan 1 (Poom 2 Promoted) and competed in KOKO KRUNCH JUNIOR Taekwondo Championships 2019 and NSG Poomsae 2024.

        <h1>Cricket</h1>
        <p>
            Cricket has been a central part of my life from a young age, starting with casual games in local parks and evolving into playing at a cricket academy. My journey has been marked by countless hours of practice, significant victories, and personal growth both on and off the field. Cricket has taught me discipline, resilience, and teamwork, shaping me into the person I am today.</p>
